TODO:
- what would it look like for categorizer to use an inverted map (keys to categories)?

- add a menu to let user assign a category using existing categories with numbers as keys:
    What category does this belong in? (1) Food  (2) Home  (3) Fun

- income vs expense logic (including dealing with transfers in and out of savings)

- deal with ignoring line items (I may not want to categorize this thing... what does that mean when I summarize?)

- how to handle duplicate categories (Jockamo, jockamo's pizza) on summarize?

- how to handle already categorized items 

- how to handle a description that matches multiple key words

- handle budgets that don't match (if a category doesn't exist in the budget, just subtract zero)

BUGS:
- CategoryMap does not ignore newly learned keys
- Fix uppercase vs lowercase
