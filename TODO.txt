TODO:
- add a menu to let user assign a category using existing categories with numbers as keys:
    What category does this belong in? (1) Food  (2) Home  (3) Fun
- income vs expense logic (including dealing with transfers in and out of savings)
- deal with ignoring line items (I may not want to categorize this thing... what does that mean when I summarize?)
- how to handle duplicate categories (Jockamo, jockamo's pizza) on summarize?
- how to handle already categorized items 
- how to handle a description that matches multiple key words
- change data layer to a "flat" injectable query object to make stubbing test data easier
- make console a UI injectable for stubbing test data
- handle budgets that don't match (if a category doesn't exist in the budget, just subtract zero)
