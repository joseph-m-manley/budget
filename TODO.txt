TODO:
- income vs expense logic (including dealing with transfers in and out of savings)
- deal with ignoring line items (I may not want to categorize this thing... what does that mean when I summarize?)
- support citi card & debit easily (make column names configurable? add an 'or' to the logic?)
- add a menu to let user assign a category using existing categories with numbers as keys:
    What category does this belong in? (1) Food  (2) Home  (3) Fun
- get 'noise' working again
