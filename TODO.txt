TODO:
- what would it look like for categorizer to use an inverted map (keys to categories)?

- we are checking for matches twice: first we "remove_known", then we still check if the item is known when we loop. If we remove the filtering part, it would make testing easier.

- add a menu to let user assign a category using existing categories with numbers as keys:
    What category does this belong in? (1) Food  (2) Home  (3) Fun

- income vs expense logic (including dealing with transfers in and out of savings)

- deal with ignoring line items (I may not want to categorize this thing... what does that mean when I summarize?)

- how to handle duplicate categories (Jockamo, jockamo's pizza) on summarize?

- how to handle already categorized items 

- how to handle a description that matches multiple key words

- should the contract to match be a single word? It may be more reliable to match a keyword a against a list of words, so the description could be split into a list. The downside is that some descriptions are mutliple words, like 'rabble coffee'. There would need to be a single unique word for each store.

- handle budgets that don't match (if a category doesn't exist in the budget, just subtract zero)
